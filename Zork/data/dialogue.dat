TRIAL ONE
Welcome to Trial 1, the 1st of 10 trials! My name is George, your guide through your trial adventure! There is only one direction you can go and that’s forward through the door behind me however you can also choose to go back to the main room. Remember, you can't leave a trial once you begin fighting the boss. The only way you get out of that is in a coffin! Good Luck!
Oh and one more thing!, you can choose one weapon or armor item to start with. Would you like a splintered branch or a leather suit?
Excellent choice! Just a tip, try not to die or you can lose a lot of your money! That wouldn't be very fun would it?
You dare challenge the king to a duel? You are sure to lose. I am the protector of the 1st key and I will do what I must to protect it. This is your last chance. Stand down, or face me.

TRIAL TWO
Hey there! Welcome to the second trial! I'm hoping you aren't challenging this trial before doing the first one. That wouldn't be very smart. Anyways if you still want to continue just head on through. Good luck

TRIAL THREE
Greetings! I hope you are doing well with your trials. In this trial you have to make it to the other end of the tunnel without being dismembered by the other contestants who have lost their minds in the tunnel. If you make it to the other end, you will be awarded with another trial key! Good luck!

TRIAL FOUR
Answer 3/5 questions correctly to complete the trial. If you fail, you will be executed…painfully. Best of luck!
